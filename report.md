# **HATs Arbitration Contracts Audit Competition on Hats.finance** 


## Introduction to Hats.finance


Hats.finance builds autonomous security infrastructure for integration with major DeFi protocols to secure users' assets. 
It aims to be the decentralized choice for Web3 security, offering proactive security mechanisms like decentralized audit competitions and bug bounties. 
The protocol facilitates audit competitions to quickly secure smart contracts by having auditors compete, thereby reducing auditing costs and accelerating submissions. 
This aligns with their mission of fostering a robust, secure, and scalable Web3 ecosystem through decentralized security solutions​.

## About Hats Audit Competition


Hats Audit Competitions offer a unique and decentralized approach to enhancing the security of web3 projects. Leveraging the large collective expertise of hundreds of skilled auditors, these competitions foster a proactive bug hunting environment to fortify projects before their launch. Unlike traditional security assessments, Hats Audit Competitions operate on a time-based and results-driven model, ensuring that only successful auditors are rewarded for their contributions. This pay-for-results ethos not only allocates budgets more efficiently by paying exclusively for identified vulnerabilities but also retains funds if no issues are discovered. With a streamlined evaluation process, Hats prioritizes quality over quantity by rewarding the first submitter of a vulnerability, thus eliminating duplicate efforts and attracting top talent in web3 auditing. The process embodies Hats Finance's commitment to reducing fees, maintaining project control, and promoting high-quality security assessments, setting a new standard for decentralized security in the web3 space​​.

## Competition Details


- Type: A public audit competition hosted by HATs Arbitration Contracts
- Duration: 2 weeks
- Maximum Reward: $28,000
- Submissions: 74
- Total Payout: $24,900.4 distributed among 8 participants.

## Scope of Audit

The scope of the competition includes all the contracts that make up the HATs system, but we are specifically interested in the changes made since v2.0.

There are a number of changes since our last release:

- We added an arbitration procedure: if there is any kind of dispute about the payout, the decision can be  escalated to an Expert Committee, and if that committee cannot find consensus, to the Kleros court. The intended behavior of that system is documented here: https://github.com/hats-finance/hats-contracts/blob/audit/docs/claims.md
- The functionality of the main contract, HATVault.sol, was split into two new files (HATVault.sol and HATClaimsManager.sol) 
- We added some helper contracts, such as the PaymentSplitter.sol

The contracts that are currently in use, v2.0, can be found here https://github.com/hats-finance/hats-contracts/tree/v2.0.  


In this competition, we are interested in the usual programming errors, but we are also interested in any scenarios in which the arbitration procedure can be abused or hijacked. (For such attacks, it is the behavior that is implemented that serves as a reference - pointing out mistakes in documentation is appreciated, but will not be rewarded). 







## Conclusion

The audit report highlights Hats.finance's efforts in securing DeFi protocols via decentralized audit competitions, a proactive approach that leverages the expertise of a wide range of auditors to identify and address vulnerabilities before project launches. Hats Audit Competitions prioritize quality and efficiency, rewarding auditors only for successful vulnerability identifications and encouraging top-tier talent participation. The recent audit competition focused on the HATs system's updates since version 2.0, particularly the new arbitration procedure aimed at resolving payout disputes through an Expert Committee and potentially the Kleros court. The competition, lasting two weeks, garnered 74 submissions and distributed $24,900.4 among eight participants. Critical changes included splitting the HATVault.sol contract and adding helper contracts like PaymentSplitter.sol. The audit emphasized detecting programming errors and potential abuses of the arbitration process, embodying Hats.finance's commitment to robust, cost-effective security measures in the web3 space.
